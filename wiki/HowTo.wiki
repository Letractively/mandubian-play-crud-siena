== How to use the CRUD-Siena Play! framework ==
=== First of all, you have to enable Siena support to your Play! project ===
 _You can find information about it directly [http://www.playframework.org/modules/siena-1.2/home there]_

 ==== YOU SHALL USE VERSION 1.2 of this siena module because it integrates Siena 0.7.5 correcting an important issue concerning JSON (de)serialization of embedded objects ====
----

=== You need to make your Siena entity inherit the class SienaSupport ===
_This is exactly the sister class of Play! default class JpaSupport_
  For example:
{{{
@Table("employees")
public class Employee extends SienaSupport {
        
        @Id(Generator.AUTO_INCREMENT)
        public Long id;
        
        @Column("first_name")
        @Max(100) @NotNull
        public String firstName;
        
        @Column("last_name")
        @Max(200) @NotNull
        public String lastName;
        
        @Column("contact_info")
        public Json contactInfo;
        
        @Column("boss") 
        @Index("boss_index")
        public Employee boss;
        
        @Filter("boss")
        public Query<Employee> employees;
               
        @Embedded
        public Image profileImage;
        
        @Embedded
        public List<Image> otherImages;

        @Embedded
        public Map<String, Image> stillImages;
        
        @EmbeddedMap
        public class Image {
                public String filename;
                public String title;
                public int views;
        }
        
        public static Query<Employee> all() {
                return Model.all(Employee.class);
        }
        
        public String toString() {
                return firstName + " " + lastName;
        }

}
}}}

Please be aware of the possibility to manage:
  * _Json_ fields
  * _One to Many_ relation
  * _Many to One_ relation
  * _Embedded_ json-serialized objects : single object/list/map


*With GAE, there are limitations to be aware of (at least for the time being until further evolutions):
  * _@Id_ annotated field corresponding to the primary key must be Long type
  * _@Id_ annotated field corresponding to the primary key must be called "id"*

=== You need to create a controller inheriting class CRUD for each Siena entity requiring CRUD support ===
_This is exactly the sister class of Play! default controller CRUD_

The name of the Controller class corresponding to a model class can be:
   * *ModelClassName* _(this option is valid on in crudsiena because I found it more intuitive)_
   For example:
{{{
public class Employee extends controllers.CRUD {    

}
}}}

   * *ModelClassName+'s'* (pluralized) _(but any char instead of 's' is OK also)_
   For example:
{{{
public class Employees extends controllers.CRUD {    

}
}}}

   * *@For(ModelClass)* annotation added to your controller 
   For example:
{{{
@For(models.Employee.class)
public class Employees extends controllers.CRUD {    

}
}}}

----

=== You need to enable routes to the CRUD module ===
At the beginning of your conf/routes file, add:
{{{
*      	/admin             						module:crudsiena
}}}
